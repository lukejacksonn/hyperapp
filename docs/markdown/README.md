# Welcome to HyperApp

HyperApp is a JavaScript library for building frontend applications.

* **Declarative**: HyperApp's design is based on the [Elm Architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/). Create scalable browser-based applications using a functional paradigm. The twist is you don't have to learn a new language.
* **Stateless components**: Build complex user interfaces from micro-components. Stateless components are framework agnostic, reusable and easier to debug.
* **Batteries-included**: Out of the box, HyperApp has Elm-like state management and a virtual DOM engine; it still weighs 1kb and has no dependencies.

HyperApp is not opinionated about your stack either; we're compatible with all bundlers and work well with [Hyperx](/hyperx.md) or [JSX](/jsx.md) -- it's your choice.
